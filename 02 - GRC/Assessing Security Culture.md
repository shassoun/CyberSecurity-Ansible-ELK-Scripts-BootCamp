**SilverCorp**

**COMPANY EXISTING SECURITY PROFILE**

- Employees at SilverCorp are increasingly using their own personal devices for company work.

- Specifically, over half of all employees check their work email and communications via Slack on their personal mobile phones.

- Another 25% of employees are doing other work-related activities using work accounts and work-related applications on their personal phone.

- Allowing sensitive work information to be shared on employees&#39; personal devices has a number of security implications.

- You must research these security risks and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate the concerns.

**STEP 1: MEASURE AND SET GOALS**

**POTENTIAL SECURITY RISKS AND ATTACKS:**

Based on the analysis of the SilverCorp security profile, the current trend of employees utilizing their personal devices for work related activities, creates a concerning and potentially high security risk to the organisations network, data, and sensitive information. These include;

- Hacking- Personal devices are known to lack data encryption which is essential to prevent attackers from snooping on private information. In addition to this, if employees are not regularly updating their devices software, this may make their device as well as SilverCorp&#39;s infrastructure vulnerable to infiltration. Personal devices are being used increasingly during this pandemic and the working from home trend, has meant that employees are also connecting to open WiFi spots in public places like cafes. The concern here, is hackers are creating their own hotspots to trick people into connecting to their WiFi, believing it is the cafe&#39;s connection. In the event the device is connected to these malicious hotspots, attackers will be able to see the users web activity, usernames and passwords, which is a grave concern to the organisations security. Man in the Middle attacks would be one of the methods used in this scenario.

- Data Leakage- Personal devices are not part of the organization&#39;s IT infrastructure, therefore they are not protected by SilverCorp&#39;s firewall and security systems. This risk may lead to unintentional loss of company data, in the event the employee loses their device. The matter of greatest concern here, is if the device is misplaced and ends up in the hands of an individual with malicious intentions, all company information, databases and infrastructure will be vulnerable. Other issues that could arise is if SilverCorp&#39;s sensitive information is sent to a personal contact on the device by mistake.

- Malware Infiltration- If an employee is using their personal device for work and personal related activities, this opens up a plethora of risks and vulnerabilities to malware. If an employee visits a restricted site or downloads an application known to be vulnerable to attacks, there is a high probability that malware and viruses will infect the device and this will leak into SilverCorp&#39;s network. This breach which will impact the organisation financially, legally and the companies reputation will be badly tarnished in the eyes of their stakeholders. From the perspective of the IT department, if the employees are using their own devices, there is another issue which will in fact increase the manpower needed for day to day operations. If employees have the choice of device to use, the process of keeping track of vulnerabilities and updates will require extra unnecessary work due to the IT department needing to be prepared for different malware attacks on different devices.

- Rooting/Jailbreaking- When a user performs any of these procedures, in essence what they are doing is undoing or bypassing the security features of the device pre installed by the manufacturer. The risks and attacks associated in this case will result in the attackers ability to access keystrokes, GPS location and network traffic and ultimately company data on the device.

- Disgruntled Employees- If an employee is unhappy or is contemplating leaving the company to join a competitor there are risks. If the employee shares confidential data related to SilverCorp to a competitor, this could have financial ramifications for the organisation. The difficult issue to manage is that the device is the property of the employee and company data and network access is on the device.
- Lack of employee training- Security breaches may occur as a result of an innocent mistake. If they are not trained and fully understand the need and method of securing their devices, then SilverCorp will be prone to external attacks. If an employee is not made aware of how attackers use phishing methods to trick users to click on email attachments that are malicious, then these types of attacks will not be eliminated.

- Unauthorised use by third party- Personal devices when used outside of the workplace (in the office), can be accessed by third parties like family or friends. If a child is using the device to play games and they innocently download an application that is in fact malicious, then this exposes the device and therefore the company data and networks to a possible attack and breach.

- Zoom &amp; Slack Applications- It is particularly concerning that over 50% of staff use their personal phones to access email and communicate via slack on their own devices. Both Slack and Zoom have been compromised in the past. In the case of Zoom, there have been cases of malicious actors bundling legitimate Zoom installs with malware files. These backdoor/Trojan type attacks are very difficult for users to identify if they don&#39;t know what to look for. Slack has previously been subject to malware in the form of ransomware. In this particular scenario, of greatest concern is the impact on both employees and SilverCorp. If an employee&#39;s mobile device is infected by ransomware, not only is their personal data but also the data of the organisation at risk of being held at ransom by malicious actors.

**PREFERRED EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOUR:**

Based on the available information we can make some recommendations what would be preferred behaviour in relation to employee use of personal devices for work related activities.

- Use of Slack, Work accounts and applications- It would be highly recommended that if employees wish to use their personal device for the purpose of sending, receiving emails and communicating, then the use of slack be limited to personal use only. For all work related emails or communication, it is recommended to use the organisation approved email/communication client with the recommended configurations. This would be more secure and would require two factor authentication. It would also be preferred that all email based communication for anything work related be conducted at either the employees home with a secured connection or in the office. The use of public WiFi connections are not recommended and for work should not be permitted.

- If employees wish to use their personal devices for work, no sensitive data should be stored on the device. To access sensitive data, this should be through secured central servers that require credentials that cannot be stolen with a minimum two factor authentication via the organisation&#39;s domain.

- All employees using personal devices should at a minimum be responsible for securing these devices with strong alphanumeric passwords as well as pattern or fingerprint access (if the device has this option).

- All personal devices should be kept up to date, this includes hardware and anti-virus software updates. Encourage employees to install a specific mobile security device application if their current application does not meet the security criteria of the organisation. Ie; AntiVirus and AntiMalware software.

- The use of third party apps that are not approved by the organisation should be removed if the employee wishes to use their personal device for work.

- Employees are responsible for the device&#39;s security to ensure no third parties have access to the device, this includes children.

- When accessing their personal emails, it is recommended that all employees are mindful and cautious when opening emails/attachments that they are not familiar with to avoid malicious attachments.

**REFER TO SURVEY DOCUMENT ATTACHED TO THE SUBMISSION**

The ultimate goal of this survey is to get an understanding of how the employees at SilverCorp utilise their devices. This survey is to be circulated to all employees as part of a 3 stage process to gauge understanding and actions of employees using their emails.

**Stage 1 is to involve our IT department, whereby they circulate a non-malicious email to all employees from an unknown sender via slack, which has a link and an attachment. Once clicked, they will be able to see who opened the attachment or clicked on the link.**

**Stage 2- the survey is circulated to all employees to be completed within 3 business days.**

**Stage 3- Once the results of the survey have been compiled, a second email from the IT dept (different to the 1st email) is sent to see if the survey had any impact on the actions of employees second time round.**

- Currently we know over half of SilverCorp&#39;s employees use their personal devices to access email via slack.
- We estimate that approximately 15% of staff will open the attachment/link of the initial email.
- The results of the survey will give us an opportunity to give the IT department a better idea of where the employees are at from a security awareness perspective, and the general sentiment in reference to their thoughts on using their personal device as an option, or due to lack of choice.
- We estimate that the percentage of employees that opened the initial email will reduce to below 10%.
- The results of this study will be the basis of an e-learning program that we believe is essential to educate SilverCorp&#39;s employees about online security, email safety, the general awareness of the risks associated with cyber attacks, and the impact on them as individuals and on the organisation. All staff will be required to complete an online assessment to ensure their understanding of all topics covered.
- Once the training program has been completed, in the weeks following the rollout of the training, a 3rd email will be sent to the staff and we believe if the click rate of the 3rd email is below 5% then we can determine the e-learning program is a success and ongoing e-learnings should be scheduled every 6 months. For all new employees it should be a part of the induction process.
- As an incentive to employees, for those who complete the elearning program and continue to follow the guidelines set, an incentive program should be established to reward them.
- For the employees who complete the program but continue to click on the link/attachment, it is recommended that they be required to choose between an organisation issued device or their personal device with all necessary security measures installed, including as a minimum:
  - Firewall
  - Two factor authentication, SSL and TLS encryption
  - Mobile Device Management Software
  - Secure VPN connection
  - Anti Malware Software

**STEP 2: PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS**

In order to achieve the goals, we have determined the following people/departments should be involved in the process:

**CEO-** The CEO has an integral role in the process. They will be ultimately accountable and responsible for SilverCorp&#39;s CyberSecurity and personnel. The CEO will work closely with the CISO to ensure the framework and strategy is tailored to SilverCorps&#39;s cyber risks.

**CISO-** Will work closely with the CEO at SilverCorp. They will analyse the immediate threats associated with the increasing use of personal devices for work related activities. Part of identifying the threats is to also ensure the employees do not misuse or steal data from the SilverCorp database. The CISO will be front and centre in the implementation of the program, as well as ensuring the program gets the funding required by reporting to the CEO and ensuring they understand the importance of the program to SilverCorp, as an organisation and all stakeholders.

**CFO-** The role of the CFO is vital to not only provide the funding for the program, but also to analyse and determine the total cost to the organisation if/when a breach occurs. With the concerning risks involved with SilverCorps employees usage of personal devices, the impact of an attack and breach on the organisation is very concerning, so the cost of the program is fully justified when compared to the projected damage a data breach would impact SilverCorp.

**CIO-** The role of the CIO in the framework will be to develop IT systems that support SilverCorp. As part of the framework, the CIO will be instrumental to ensure the required systems are available to provide employees who require access to the database are not doing so whereby the organisation is exposed to attacks and potential breaches. This may also include the development and role out of the e-learning modules to all employees.

**DIRECTOR OF HR-** The head of HR will be responsible for liaising with the C-suite executives and the Training and Development team to ensure there are no potential breaches that SilverCorp can be held responsible for with employees. These include issues such as privacy, re-education or potential termination of employees deemed to be committing offences against the organisation. The HR department will also be responsible for developing an incentive program for employees who are seen to be &#39;buying in&#39; to the security framework.

**HEAD OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT-** The main responsibility for the training department will be to develop a training program in conjunction with the recommendations of the CISO and HR departments that will provide adequate training and understanding for all employees at SilverCorp.

**STEP 3 : TRAINING PROGRAM**

The training program that has been proposed to be developed at SilverCorp will be delivered via e-learning modules via the Employees HR platform. This will be in the form of theory to be delivered in the following manner;

- Written form
- Video
- Case studies where the employee answers questions in a multiple choice format, the choice they make on one question then determines the path that response will lead to.
- Assessment-multiple choice 100% pass score required.
- The assessment would need to be repeated if 100% was not achieved.

Initially, it is proposed that the training program will be run to get a measured understanding of how employees understood the importance of cybersecurity and the risks associated with actions that can lead to serious consequences. The training program is estimated to be completed within 5 business days of rollout and to be repeated every 6 months. It will be mandatory to complete, and will be incorporated into the induction program for new employees.

The topics to be covered as part of the training program will include the following topics;

- Email Scams- to address the dangers associated with Phishing attacks by opening unsolicited emails, how to filter spam emails, as well as how to avoid clicking unknown links in emails.

- Malware attacks- Avoiding unauthorised software, regularly updating devices and antivirus software. Always be suspicious of files in emails.

- Password Security- The dangers of poor password selection and risks associated, using passwords that are unique with a mix of letter, numbers characters, uppercase and lowercase letters. Encourage the use of Multi-Factor authentication. Use a password manager that can create strong passwords for different accounts.
- Removable Media- If employees are using their laptops/PC&#39;s for work related activities. Discussing and educating on the dangers of malicious malware or ransomware, that can be installed and infect the device and impact the organisation. Never plug a USB stick into a device that hasn&#39;t been verified and the importance of disabling autorun on all devices.

- Safe Internet Habits- How to identify a secure connection (HTTPS), dangers of downloading untrusted software off the internet. Addressing the risk associated with entering information onto untrusted websites and the ramifications of spoofing and phishing.

- Social Networking Dangers- Phishing attacks can occur, as well as information shared over the internet can be used against the user. Cybercriminals can be impersonating people or brands they compromised to attack other individuals or organisations.

- Physical Security and Environmental Controls- Being mindful of surroundings when entering passwords, never leave written passwords or sensitive information laying around, as well as the danger of leaving devices unlocked with sensitive data on display.

- Use of Personal Devices- enabling full disk encryption for laptops/PC&#39;s, using a VPN on devices when connected to untrusted WiFi spots. All devices should be running the SilverCorp approved AntiVirus and AntiMalware software. Only download applications form trusted app stores or from the manufacturers website.

- Use of Slack for email and communications- It is important for the employees to understand the risks associated when handling sensitive company information and identity data. If slack is not the recommended application to use for work emails or communication then education or further training is required on the approved software with tighter security controls end to end.

**OTHER SECURITY CONTROLS:**

It is recommended that while all existing employees of SilverCorp have the option of using personal devices for work related activities, it is strongly advisable that new employees of the organisation are given organisation approved and issued devices to ensure the highest level of security. This does not eliminate the need for ongoing training and education of employees.

**COMPANY ISSUED DEVICES (For Exclusive use of work related activities)**

- This control would be a Physical control, as the SilverCorp issued device will be pre-configured to the organisations strictest security guidelines to ensure the device is safe to use for the employee, and the organisation data and systems are secured.
- The goal of utilising this type of control is as a Deterrent. Secured devices whilst they are not impenetrable, provide multiple layers of added security which an attacker may think twice about attacking.
- The advantage to this solution is that the organisation has the opportunity to focus on educating the employee on the ongoing use of the secured device and how to maintain security, as opposed to educating them how to secure their own device which they may be hesitant to do as they may feel it has privacy issues.
- The disadvantage to this control is that there is a financial component to needing to provide employees with company issued devices.

**PERSONAL**** DEVICES WITH MOBILE DEVICE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE**

- This control would be a Technical control, as this would give the IT department the permission to apply all security controls to update software, block malicious applications, initiate backups or even wipe lost or compromised devices remotely.
- The goal of this control would be a combination between Deterrent and Detective as the IT department would have greater control over the device and the activity occurring on it.
- The advantage of this control would be one sided for the organisation as SilverCorp would have greater control over the device.
- The disadvantage of this control is the employee may feel there has been a breach in privacy as well as a feeling as if they can&#39;t be trusted. This will in turn impact on their productivity as an employee at SilverCorp.
