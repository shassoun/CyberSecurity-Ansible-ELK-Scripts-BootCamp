Backdoor:A type of malware that is able to avoid normal authentication to access a computer or network. This can be authorised or unauthorised users gaining access by avoiding existing security measures.

Keylogger: are used to create logs of everything a user on a computer types. They usually work quietly in the background monitoring activity while the device works normally as if nothing is affecting it.
