The Primary dealer working at the times of the losses was Billy Jones. Billy was also working at the times where the highest profits were recorded.
 This, in my opinion was to act as a cover for the obvious collusion with a particular player where the losses occurred.

Billy Jones was the dealer at the Roulette table 13 times which is the exact number of times Lucky Duck suffered losses during that period of time.
