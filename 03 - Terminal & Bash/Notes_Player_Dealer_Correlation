Based on the analysis of the dealer schedule and the Player analysis, I was able to make the following findings;

During the periods  of March 10th, March 12th and March 15th, Lucky Duck Casino suffered 13 losses in that period on the Roulette Table.
Looking at the player analysis file, I was able to establish that during these periods, there was one specific player who frequented the
Roulette table a total of 32 times. This particular player was also coicidentally present at the Roulette table on every occasion there
were heavy losses for the casino. The player in questions name is Mylie Schmidt.

On the 10th and 12th of March, the losses on the Roulette table occurred at 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm. On the 15th this was similar with 
the losses occuring at 5am, 8am and 2pm. Interestingly, the 8pm and 11pm schedule saw the heaviest profits recorded over the 3 day period.
This then led to me having a very detailed look at the dealer schedule during these three days. The result of this analysis drew some concerning
results. On each of the 13 occasions where Lucky Duck Casino suffered heavy losses, the dealer on those particular shifts happened to be the same
person. This person was Billy Jones. This led to me coming to the conclusion that the player Mylie Schmidt and dealer Billy Jones colluded
together on the roulette table to financially gain at Lucky Duck Casino by illegal means. 

Based on the evidence I have provided, I firmly believe that on the 15th of March, at 8pm and 11pm when Billy Jones was rostered on the roulette 
table, with Mylie Schmidt away from the table there was a cover up. These 2 timeslots recorded the largest profits recorded over the 3 days. I am of
the opinion that this was intentional in an effort to cover his tracks since he and Mylie Schmidt had already made an extensive financial gain on 13 
previous occasions. He must have known that eventually he would be uncovered and needed to 'cover his tracks'.
